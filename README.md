# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
Customer churn is a critical business problem where customers stop doing business with a company. This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and predicting churn using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

## Problem Statement
Businesses often face challenges in identifying customers who are likely to churn. The inability to recognize such customers results in higher costs to acquire new ones and lost revenue. The problem this project addresses is to analyze customer data, predict churn, and help businesses implement targeted retention strategies.

---

## Objective
1. Analyze customer data to uncover churn patterns.
2. Build predictive models to identify customers likely to churn.
3. Provide actionable recommendations for churn reduction.
4. Develop an easy-to-understand Power BI dashboard for real-time monitoring.

## Key Features & Business Functions
- Data Exploration: Uncover trends and relationships in customer data.
- Feature Engineering: Identify the most critical factors influencing churn.
- Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning to predict churn likelihood.
- Visualization: Design dashboards for monitoring and reporting.
- Business Recommendations: Provide insights to improve customer retention.

## Project Implementation

### Steps Taken
1. Data Collection: 
   - Used a customer behavior dataset (e.g., telecom dataset, e-commerce logs).
2. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualized patterns such as churn rate by customer demographics, product usage, and billing data.
4. Feature Engineering:
   - Created new features like `tenure groups`, `monthly charges range`, and `engagement scores`.
5. Machine Learning Models:
   - Built and evaluated models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
6. Dashboard Creation:
   - Created an interactive Power BI dashboard for key metrics like churn rate, customer segmentation, and actionable KPIs.
